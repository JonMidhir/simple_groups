Simple Groups
========

This plugin creates a group model and relates it to your User model via a has_many :through relationship. It is designed for use with restful_authentication but could be used with any User model.

To install:

script/plugin install git://github.com/JonMidhir/simple_groups.git

To use:

script/generate simple_groups Group

If you wish you can rename the last parameter anything you want, but Group is probably the most appropriate! Add --skip-migration to avoid creating the migration files.

Remember to run the migrations:
rake db:migrate

Example
=======

These methods are available on the user model after installation, many are self.explanatory!

user.groups
user.pending_groups
user.is_member_of?(group)
user.is_mod_of?(group)
user.request_membership_of(group)
user.pending_and_accepted_groups
user.membership(group)
user.leave(group)

The following can be called on the group model.

group.members
group.mods
group.pending_members
group.accept_member(user)
group.pending_and_accepted_members
group.kick(user)
group.mods_online
group.members_online
group.members_offline
group.has_member?(user)
